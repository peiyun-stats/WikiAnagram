1. Please make sure you have python and the following packages installed.
- urllib
- urllib2
- json
- re
- pyenchant
- csv (come in default I think)
- sys (come in default I think)

2. In the command line, please change directory (the cd command) to the folder where you put ‘homework.py’ on your local drive.

3. The way to call it is 
python homework.py "yourlink"
e.g.
python homework.py "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidhya_Devi_Bhandari||https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(Shakespeare%27s_wife)"

It will save the results in 'output.csv' in your local directory. If you want to specify a name for the output, just add the name after the links. For example:
python homework.py "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidhya_Devi_Bhandari||https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(Shakespeare%27s_wife)" output2.csv

Please note that, multiple links must be ‘||’ separated.
