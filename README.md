**Thrid, the way to call the program**

- python homework.py "yourlink", for example: *python homework.py "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidhya_Devi_Bhandari"*

- It will save the results in 'output.csv' in your local directory. If you want to specify a name for the output, just add the name after the links. For example: *python homework.py "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidhya_Devi_Bhandari||https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(Shakespeare%27s_wife)" output2.csv*

Please note that, multiple links must be ‘||’ separated, and don't forget the quote before and after links.
